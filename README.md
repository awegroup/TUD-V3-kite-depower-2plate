# TUD-V3-kite-depower-2plate

Two-plate model of the  depower mechanism for the TU Delft V3 kite.
A tetrahedron and trilateration algorithm calculates the width change of the two-plate model due to bridle line length changes, representing the symmetric actuation of the kite that alters the power setting.
